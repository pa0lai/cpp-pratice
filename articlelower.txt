it’s
a
gloomy
april
afternoon
in
rural
oklahoma,
and
i’m
sitting
on
the
floor
of
a
fluorescent-lit
room
at
a
roadside
zoo
with
nova,
a
12-week-old
tiliger.
she
looks
like
a
tiger
cub,
but
she’s
actually
a
crossbreed,
an
unnatural
combination
of
a
tiger
father
and
a
mother
born
of
a
tiger
and
a
lion.
that
unique
genetic
makeup
places
a
higher
price
tag
on
cubs
like
nova,
and
makes
it
easier,
legally
speaking,
to
abuse
and
exploit
them.
endangered
species
protections
don’t
apply
to
artificial
breeds
such
as
tiligers.
hybridization,
however,
has
done
nothing
to
quell
nova’s
predatory
instincts.
for
the
umpteenth
time
during
the
past
six
minutes,
she
lunges
at
my
face,
claws
splayed
and
mouth
ajar
—
only
to
be
halted
mid-leap
as
her
handler
jerks
her
harness.
unphased,
nova
gets
right
back
to
pouncing.
with
her
dusty
blue
eyes,
sherbet-colored
paws,
and
prominent
black
stripes,
nova
is
adorable.
but
she
also
weighs
30
pounds
and
has
teeth
like
a
doberman’s
and
claws
the
size
of
jumbo
shrimp.
nova’s
handler,
a
woman
with
long
brown
hair
who
tells
me
she
recently
retired
from
her
it
job
at
a
south
dakota
bank
to
live
out
her
dream
of
working
with
exotic
cats,
scolds
the
rambunctious
tiliger
in
a
goo-goo-ga-ga
voice:
“nooooo,
nooooo,
you
calms
down!”
nova
is
teething,
the
handler
explains,
so
she
just
wants
something
to
chew
on.
the
handler
reaches
for
one
of
the
tatty
stuffed
animals
strewn
around
the
room
—
a
substitute,
i
guess,
for
my
limbs.
in
that
moment
of
distraction,
nova
lunges.
she
lands
her
mark,
chomping
into
the
bicep
of
my
producer,
graham
lee
brewer.
“ooo,
she
got
me!”
lee
brewer
grimaces
as
he
attempts
to
pull
away
from
the
determined
predator.
nova’s
handler
has
to
pry
the
tiliger’s
jaws
open
to
detach
her.
after
the
incident,
the
woman
conveniently
checks
her
watch:
“ok,
you
guys,
time
is
up!”
i
paid
$80
for
the
pleasure
of
spending
12
minutes
with
nova,
but
i’m
glad
the
experience,
billed
as
a
once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity,
is
over.
on
our
way
out,
we
pass
more
than
a
dozen
adult
tigers
yowling
and
pacing
cages
the
size
of
small
classrooms.
nearby
signs
solicit
donations.
you
are
their
only
hope.
sponsor
a
cabin
or
compound
today!
in
the
safety
of
our
car,
lee
brewer
rolls
up
his
sleeve,
exposing
a
swollen
red
welt.
“look
at
my
gnarly
tiger
bite,”
he
chuckles.
“i
tried
to
play
it
off
but
i
was
like,
this
fuckin’
hurts!”
it’s
not
the
first
time
i’ve
seen
this
world
up-close;
i
spent
the
better
part
of
eight
years
investigating
wildlife
trafficking
around
the
world.
during
my
travels,
i
visited
farms
in
china
and
laos
where
tigers
are
raised
like
pigs,
examined
traditional
medicine
in
vietnam,
ate
what
i
was
told
was
tiger
bone
“cake,”
and
tracked
some
of
the
world’s
last
remaining
wild
tigers
in
india.
almost
everywhere
i
went,
tigers
were
suffering
and
their
numbers
were
on
the
decline
because
of
human
behavior.
until
recently,
though,
i
had
no
idea
the
united
states
was
part
of
the
problem.
within
a
few
weeks
of
my
visit,
nova
will
be
far
too
big
and
dangerous
for
overpriced
playtime
sessions.
cats
like
her
are
most
likely
confined
to
one
of
those
cramped
cages
my
producer
and
i
passed
leaving
the
zoo,
where
they
spend
the
rest
of
their
life
being
speed-bred
to
crank
out
more
adorable
cubs.
or
nova
might
be
sold
to
another
breeder,
or
to
someone
who
wants
to
keep
her
as
a
pet.
although
no
one
tracks
big
cat
ownership
in
the
u.s.,
it’s
estimated
that
there
are
likely
more
pet
tigers
in
america
than
there
are
left
in
the
wild.
what’s
more,
depending
on
the
species
of
cat,
federal
oversight
is
either
limited
or
nonexistent.
in
some
states,
it’s
easier
to
buy
a
lion
—
a
400-pound
predatory
killer
—
than
it
is
to
get
a
dog.
animal
rights
activists
have
been
pushing
for
decades
to
curb
big
cat
ownership
in
this
country,
arguing
that
the
industry
is
cruel,
dangerous,
and
detrimental
to
conservation
of
cats
in
the
wild.
now,
reform
appears
within
reach.
the
movement
owes
its
momentum
to,
of
all
things,
a
murder-for-hire
plot
gone
terribly
awry.
you
might
have
seen
the
headlines
in
the
washington
post
and
new
york
magazine:
joe
exotic,
a
self-described
“gay,
gun-carrying
redneck
with
a
mullet,”
among
the
largest
tiger
owners
and
breeders
in
the
u.s.,
charged
with
conspiring
to
commit
murder
for
hire.
at
its
height,
joe’s
zoo
in
wynnewood,
oklahoma,
which
is
where
i
visited
nova,
housed
more
than
200
big
cats,
including
lion-tiger
hybrids,
as
well
as
about
60
other
species,
everything
from
lemurs
to
owls
to
giraffes.
joe
even
acquired
a
pair
of
alligators
he
claimed
were
once
owned
by
michael
jackson.
still,
as
one
local
told
me,
“the
animals
weren’t
the
entertainment.
joe
was
the
entertainment.”
last
year,
an
oklahoma
city
jury
convicted
joe,
whose
legal
name
is
joseph
maldonado-passage,
of
the
murder-for-hire
plots
against
a
florida
activist
and
sanctuary
owner
named
carole
baskin.
for
joe,
baskin
had
become
something
of
an
arch
tiger
rival.
the
news
coverage
mostly
focused
on
joe’s
outlandish
personality
and
the
details
of
his
decade-long
feud
with
baskin.
but
the
jury
also
found
joe
guilty
of
17
wildlife
crimes,
including
illegally
killing
five
tigers
and
trafficking
tigers
across
state
lines
—
marking
the
first
significant
conviction
of
a
tiger
criminal
in
an
american
courtroom.
“this
verdict
sends
a
shot
across
the
bow
to
other
roadside
zoos
who
are
playing
fast
and
loose
with
federal
regulations,”
said
carney
anne
nasser,
director
of
the
animal
welfare
clinic
at
michigan
state
university
college
of
law.
in
other
words,
the
bad
boy
of
the
big
cat
world
might
have
inadvertently
contributed
to
cleaning
up
the
dirty
industry
he
helped
build
and
then
exploited
for
much
of
his
adult
life.
big
cats
are
easier
to
find
than
you
might
think.
i
recently
struck
up
a
conversation
with
the
chef
at
my
favorite
sushi
joint
in
new
york
city.
he
asked
what
i’d
been
working
on,
and
i
filled
him
in
on
a
bit
of
the
joe
exotic
story
and
the
big
cat
trade.
to
my
surprise,
he
nodded
along
knowingly:
“oh
yeah,
a
buddy
of
mine
just
got
a
serval!”
celebrity
culture
is
another
hot
spot
for
exotic
animal
ownership.
this
past
fall,
justin
bieber
reportedly
spent
$35,000
on
two
savannah
cats
and
created
a
dedicated
instagram
page
that
quickly
amassed
more
than
500,000
followers.
when
peta
criticized
bieber’s
new
pet
choice,
he
posted
a
statement
on
his
instagram
story
telling
the
nonprofit
group
to
“suck
it”
and
“focus
on
real
problems.”
shopping
for
an
unconventional
animal
used
to
mean
scanning
the
classified
sections
of
newspapers
or
fliers
on
the
cluttered
billboards
at
grocery
stores
and
gas
stations.
but
those
analog
methods
of
sale
have
long
since
given
way
to
people
hawking
large
cats
in
ways
that
are
now
more
traditionally
modern:
closed
facebook
groups
and
exotic
pet
websites.
getting
an
ocelot
or
a
cheetah
can
be
as
easy
as
sending
a
dm
or
text,
agreeing
on
a
price,
and
setting
a
pick-up
date.
depending
on
what
state
you
live
in,
owning
one
of
these
animals
might
be
entirely
legal.
and
even
if
it’s
not,
there’s
almost
always
a
way
to
sidestep
the
rules,
which
can
be
confusing
and
are
rarely
enforced.
save
for
a
handful
of
regulations
pertaining
to
animals
listed
in
the
endangered
species
act
(esa),
there’s
almost
no
oversight
of
big
cat
ownership
by
the
federal
government.
the
animal
welfare
act
is
supposed
to
ensure
humane
treatment
of
big
cats
and
other
captive
animals,
but
the
inspectors
are
overworked
and
many
of
the
rules
are
weak,
vague,
or
both.
although
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
(fws)
does
technically
require
a
permit
to
sell
endangered
species
such
as
tigers,
lions,
leopards,
or
jaguars
across
state
lines,
unscrupulous
sellers
and
buyers
often
don’t
want
to
bother
with
permits
and
deal
in
untraceable
cash
payments.
at
trial,
one
buyer
even
testified
to
participating
in
sales
marked
as
“donations.”
joe
exotic
used
this
tactic
for
years
to
evade
the
gaze
of
law
enforcement.
he
wasn’t
the
only
one.
at
joe’s
trial,
that
same
tiger
owner
testified:
“everybody
marks
donation.”
same
goes
for
regulations
at
the
state
level:
loopholes
abound
in
the
legislative
patchwork
governing
big
cat
ownership.
“there’s
lots
of
ways
tigers
have
been
technically
regulated
on
paper
but
in
practice,
not
so
much,”
nasser
said.
roughly
two
thirds
of
states
have
some
sort
of
regulations
prohibiting
private
big
cat
ownership
as
pets.
in
10
states,
anyone
can
own
a
lion
or
tiger
as
long
as
they
pay
as
little
as
$30
for
a
license
from
the
u.s.
department
of
agriculture
(usda).
four
states
—
north
carolina,
wisconsin,
nevada,
and
oklahoma—
have
no
laws
on
the
books
at
all.
rules
aside,
very
few
people,
no
matter
how
well-intentioned,
are
prepared
to
own
one
of
the
world’s
largest,
deadliest
predators.
“everybody
wants
a
tiger
cub,
but
nobody
wants
a
tiger,”
said
tim
harrison,
a
retired
ohio
police
officer
and
first
responder
who
specialized
in
exotic
creatures.
these
days,
harrison
runs
outreach
for
animals,
a
nonprofit
that
advocates
responsible
exotic
pet
ownership
and
trains
emergency
personnel
to
safely
deal
with
animal-related
crises.
harrison
used
to
be
a
big
cat
owner
himself,
before
realizing
his
mistake.
“i
was
on
the
dark
side,”
he
said,
“thinking
i
was
doing
the
right
thing.”
many
big
cat
owners
are
subjected
to
what
harrison
describes
as
a
“baptism
in
reality,”
learning
firsthand
that
these
adult
cats
are
expensive
and
dangerous.
“a
big
cat
is
like
a
walking,
thinking
ied,”
he
said.
“you
don’t
know
when
that
thing’s
going
to
go
off.”
one
of
the
most
famous
incidents
took
place
in
2003
at
a
live
performance
by
the
popular
entertainment
act
siegfried
and
roy.
one
of
the
duo’s
iconic
white
tigers,
mantacore,
knocked
down
roy
horn,
grabbed
him
by
the
neck,
and
dragged
him
away.
first
responders
rushed
horn
to
the
hospital
in
critical
condition.
he
survived
but
only
returned
to
the
stage
once
more
years
later.
defenders
of
the
popular
act
contended
that
horn
suffered
a
stroke
mid-act
and
mantacore
was
just
trying
to
help
him,
but
harrison
disagreed.
he
argued
on
national
television
that
mantacore
had
intended
to
kill
roy,
and
that
roy
had
brought
this
upon
himself:
he’d
disrespected
the
largest
predatory
cat
in
the
world
by
forcing
the
animal
to
do
magic
tricks.
no
agency
tracks
the
number
of
people
attacked
and
killed
by
captive
big
cats.
according
to
a
database
of
incidents
compiled
by
the
humane
society
of
the
united
states,
24
people
have
died
and
294
have
been
injured
in
the
u.s.
since
1990.
those
figures
likely
only
represent
a
fraction
of
the
real
numbers.
not
every
case
makes
the
news,
and
the
people
involved
in
these
incidents
don’t
always
divulge
the
true
cause
of
injury.
in
1999,
when
a
family’s
pet
tiger
killed
a
10-year-old
girl
in
texas,
the
victim’s
mother
initially
told
emergency
dispatchers
that
her
daughter
had
cut
her
neck
by
falling
off
a
fence.

(she’d
later
testify
she
did
not
recall
making
the
phone
call.)
in
2003,
a
man
in
new
york
city
visited
the
hospital
for
a
severe
wound
on
his
arm
and
leg;
he
claimed
to
have
been
bitten
by
a
pit
bull
—
not
by
ming,
the
400-pound
tiger
he
had
holed
up
in
his
harlem
apartment.
big
cats
can
threaten
more
than
just
their
owners.
the
most
infamous
example
occurred
in
2011,
when
exotic
animal
owner
terry
thompson
opened
the
doors
to
almost
all
of
his
pets’
cages
before
shooting
himself.
in
what
came
to
be
known
as
the
zanesville
massacre,
law
enforcement
officers
had
to
hunt
and
kill
18
tigers,
17
lions,
and
three
mountain
lions,
as
well
as
bears,
a
baboon,
and
wolves.
“it
was
like
jumanji
in
real
life,”
said
harrison,
who
was
one
of
the
two
dozen
or
so
officers
who
responded
to
the
incident.
many
of
the
people
who
responded
to
the
call
that
day
suffered
from
post-traumatic
stress
disorder,
harrison
claimed.
they
had
no
choice
but
to
kill
the
animals,
then
they
faced
virulent
public
backlash
for
doing
so.
zanesville
is
an
extreme
example,
but
it’s
not
the
only
case
of
exotics
turned
loose.
one
problem
is
there’s
a
lack
of
places
equipped
to
take
in
these
animals
—
even
zoos
don’t
want
them.
since
starring
in
a
2011
documentary
the
elephant
in
the
living
room,
about
exotic
cat
ownership,
harrison
gets
about
30
calls
a
year
from
people
desperate
to
find
a
new
home
for
their
lions
or
tigers.
with
few
options,
some
people
donate
their
cats
to
shady
facilities
that
use
them
for
breeding.
others
abandon
them.
the
new
york
times
recently
reported
that
a
woman
looking
for
a
place
to
smoke
a
joint
stumbled
upon
a
caged
tiger
in
a
vacant
home
in
houston.
unsurprisingly,
the
owner
did
not
immediately
come
forward
to
claim
the
tiger,
but
she
was
later
arrested
and
charged
with
one
misdemeanor
count
of
cruelty
to
a
nonlivestock
animal.
as
a
boy,
joe
exotic
raised
pigeons
and
captured
porcupines,
racoons,
and
baby
antelope
at
his
childhood
homes
in
kansas
and
rural
wyoming.
but
it
was
the
death
of
his
older
brother,
garold
wayne,
in
a
car
accident
in
1997,
that
precipitated
joe’s
entrance
into
the
tiger
business:
joe
convinced
his
parents
to
use
the
roughly
$140,000
settlement
they
received
to
open
a
wildlife
rescue
center.
before
joe
and
his
parents
had
completed
the
first
cages
at
the
gw
exotic
animal
memorial
foundation
in
1999,
someone
dropped
off
an
unwanted
mountain
lion
and
black
bear.
soon
after,
they
received
a
call
about
two
tigers,
a
black
leopard,
and
a
mountain
lion
found
in
a
backyard.
joe
set
out
with
a
horse
trailer
and
tranquilizers
to
collect
the
animals,
which
were
skinny
and
malnourished.
when
joe
spoke
to
me
this
spring
on
the
phone
from
a
county
jail
in
oklahoma,
he
told
me
there
was
an
excitement
about
the
uncertainty
and
possibility
of
those
early
days.
“i
had
no
intention
of
being
joe
exotic
or
the
tiger
king
or
anything
like
that,”
said
joe,
who
came
up
with
the
“tiger
king”
moniker
because
people
struggled
to
pronounce
his
original
surname,
schreibvogel.
“but
i
never
said
no
to
a
rescue.”

pretty
soon,
joe
started
breeding
his
own
tigers.
he
bred
some
400
big
cats
over
the
years.
he
sold
the
animals
to
buyers
on
both
coasts
for
as
much
as
$5,000
each.
by
the
mid-2000s,
joe
had
become
one
of
the
largest
exotic
animal
operators
in
the
country.
he
owned
dozens
of
species
and
put
together
a
traveling
magic
show.
although
joe
had
been
“about
the
animals”
in
the
beginning,
as
time
passed,
according
to
joe’s
ex-boyfriend
john
finlay,
fame
and
profit
monopolized
his
thinking.
joe’s
niece,
chealsi
putman,
who
helped
out
at
the
zoo
for
years,
noticed
the
same
evolution.
“it’s
like
he’s
seen
dollar
signs,”
putman
told
me.
“he
figured
out
a
way
to
make
money
and
ran
with
it.”
not
all
big
cat
owners
are
similarly
motivated.
for
some,
it’s
a
grossly
misplaced
desire
to
help
an
endangered
species
—
not
realizing
that
big
cats
bred
in
the
u.s.
are
hybridized
mutts
that
have
no
genetic
worth
for
wild
tiger
conservation.
for
others,
like
54-year-old
deborah
pierce,
the
motivation
is
something
more
akin
to
love,
or
infatuation.
pierce
started
small,
rehabbing
injured
wildlife
at
her
house
and
volunteering
and
working
at
a
local
veterinary
clinic
and
zoo
after
she
graduated
from
high
school.
but
helping
lion
keepers
wasn’t
enough
to
satisfy
pierce.
“i
wanted
one
of
my
own
to
just
spend
time
with,”
she
said.
pierce
was
encouraged
when
she
learned
that
at
the
time
her
home
state
of
south
carolina
had
no
laws
preventing
her
from
owning
a
big
cat.
she
talked
her
husband
into
helping
her
construct
a
double-fenced
pen
on
their
secluded,
wooded
property.
she
easily
found
a
dealer
on
the
internet
selling
lion
cubs
for
$1,500
—
like
nova,
“picture
babies”
that
were
too
large
for
cub
petting
by
the
time
of
sale
—
and
arranged
to
purchase
a
female
cub.
“i
could
afford
her
easier
than
i
could
afford
a
new
bulldog,”
pierce
said.
she
named
the
lion
elsa,
and
a
few
months
later,
she
got
charlie,
a
baby
cougar,
to
keep
elsa
company.
that
was
12
years
ago.
pierce’s
perspective
has
since
changed.
she’s
emptied
her
savings
account
on
her
cats.
they
eat
$5,000
worth
of
meat
a
year
and
the
veterinary
bills
run
around
$10,000
annually.
last
year,
the
county
hit
her
with
an
$1,100
fine
for
not
having
the
proper
paperwork.
(south
carolina
started
regulating
big
cats
in
2018.)
pierce
no
longer
has
time
to
ride
horses,
her
other
great
love,
and
her
husband
left
her
in
2016,
breaking
not
only
her
heart,
she
said,
but
also
charlie
and
elsa’s.
she’s
put
a
dream
of
moving
out
to
arizona
on
hold
as
well.
state
laws
there
strictly
regulate
private
ownership
of
big
cats,
and
finding
a
sanctuary
where
elsa
and
charlie
could
stay
has
proven
too
difficult.
“they’re
my
best
friends,”
pierce
said,
“but
if
i
had
it
all
to
go
over
again,
i
wouldn’t
have
gotten
them.”
at
this
point,
pierce
has
resigned
herself
to
the
long
haul,
perhaps
as
many
as
another
eight
years
given
the
lifespan
of
captive
big
cats.
“i
just
want
to
be
able
to
give
elsa
and
charlie
a
happy
life,”
she
said.
“their
happiness
is
more
important
than
mine,
in
my
eyes.”
a
month
after
i
visited
pierce,
she
emailed
with
bad
news.
charlie
had
died
in
surgery.
“his
heart
was
still
beating,
but
he
wouldn’t
breathe
when
the
oxygen
came
off,”
she
wrote.
“so,
we
let
him
slip
away.”
elsa,
she
says,
has
been
inconsolable,
and
deb
blames
herself
for
not
bringing
charlie
to
the
vet
earlier.
the
bill
for
charlie’s
last
visit,
which
totaled
$4,800,
even
after
the
vet
gave
pierce
a
significant
discount,
has
only
added
to
her
stress.
“i
just
hope
nothing
happens
to
elsa
before
money
is
available
again,”
she
says.
“that’s
my
number
one
worry
right
now.”
the
modern
exotic
animal
craze
traces
back
to
the
’70s
and
’80s
and
a
phenomenon
called
zoo
babies.
each
spring,
interstate
signs
and
tv
commercials
featured
photos
of
blue-eyed,
squealing
balls
of
fuzz
debuting
at
major
zoos
around
the
country,
an
irresistible
marketing
lure
for
families
that
turned
out
to
snap
photos
and
cuddle
the
newest
arrivals.
zoo
babies
were
among
the
industry’s
number
one
moneymaking
programs,
and
tigers
were
always
the
biggest
draw.
as
an
added
bonus,
zoos
advertised
these
activities
under
the
guise
of
conservation.
“you’d
get
your
t-shirt,
get
your
picture
taken,
and
you’d
walk
away
feeling
like
you’ve
saved
the
world
—
you’ve
saved
tigers,”
harrison
said.
but
there
was
a
problem,
and
harrison,
who
worked
as
an
exotic
animal
veterinary
assistant
as
a
teenager
in
ohio,
noticed
it.
there
were
lots
of
zoo
babies
but
no
zoo
adolescents.
when
harrison
eventually
began
asking
the
staff
about
what
had
happened
to
last
year’s
tiger
cubs,
he’d
get
vague
answers
about
the
animals
being
traded
off
to
different
zoos.
to
harrison,
that
math
didn’t
add
up:
even
the
largest
zoos
around
the
country
had
only
two
or
three
adult
tigers.
but
zoos
annually
paraded
hundreds
of
babies
out
for
pictures
and
play
sessions.
harrison
eventually
learned
the
dark
truth:
after
the
cubs
reached
a
certain
age
they
became
“zoo
surplus”
and
were
sold
at
exotic
animal
auctions
to
private
buyers.
these
auctions
were
raucous
events,
attended
mostly
by
veteran
wildlife
keepers
and
professional
breeders
that
zoos
relied
on
to
supply
their
collections.
harrison
attended
a
few
and
noticed
the
same
employees
who
weeks
earlier
had
been
talking
up
the
conservation
value
of
the
zoo’s
tiger
babies,
holding
cub
after
cub
up
by
their
armpits
to
sell
to
the
highest
buyer.
the
whole
scene
was
commonplace
at
the
time.
“no
one
thought
anything
of
it,”
harrison
said.
the
zoo
baby
phenomenon
led
to
a
surge
in
private
big
cat
ownership.
in
the
1990s,
according
to
harrison,
wildlife-related
television
spread
the
idea
of
owning
a
pet
tiger
to
a
much
wider
audience.
jack
hanna
types
bottle-fed
cubs
and
paraded
tigers
on
leashes
on
talk
shows.
the
predators
appeared
no
more
dangerous
than
a
golden
retriever.
“it
was
like
somebody
flipped
a
switch
on,”
harrison
said.
at
the
time,
harrison
was
the
lone
police
officer
in
ohio
who
could
handle
big
cat
emergencies;
he
suddenly
went
from
getting
a
couple
calls
a
year
to
getting
more
than
100.
after
removing
an
unruly
pet
from
someone’s
property,
he’d
ask
people
why
they
thought
it
was
a
good
idea
to
own
a
lion
or
tiger.
many
responded
it
was
because
they’d
seen
it
on
tv.
harrison
started
calling
it
the
steve
irwin
syndrome.
that
turns
out
to
be
an
apt
diagnosis.
according
to
research
conducted
by
scientists
at
duke
university,
seeing
a
wild
animal
in
an
unnatural,
human
setting
—
a
chimpanzee
drinking
out
of
a
baby
bottle
or
sitting
through
a
talk
show
interview
—
makes
people
less
likely
to
donate
to
a
conservation
organization
that
aids
that
species
and
more
likely
to
think
the
creature
in
question
would
make
a
great
pet.
according
to
kara
walker,
now
a
behavioral
ecologist
at
north
carolina
state
university
and
lead
author
of
the
research,
published
in
2011
in
the
journal
plos

this
also
extends
to
people’s
thought
process
after
an
encounter
with
a
cub,
which
might
go
something
like:

at
this
cuddly
tiger!
i
got
to
pet
it
for
20
minutes
and
it
licked
my
hand
and
now
i
can
have
a
tiger,
too!
enterprising
private
exotic
animal
owners
capitalized
on
the
moment.
they
realized
they
could
make
a
killing
holding
their
own
cub
petting
events
at
malls,
fairs,
and
roadside
zoos,
which
compounded
an
already
vicious
breeding
pattern.
“i
call
it
the
breed
and
dump
cycle,”
said
nasser,
the
michigan
state
law
professor.
that
cycle
is
largely
responsible
for
the
proliferation
of
tigers
throughout
the
u.s.,
and
by
the
middle
of
the
last
decade,
the
most
notorious
of

to
joe

but
cub-petting
events
weren’t
enough
for
joe.
concerned
with
fame
and
fortune,
he
plotted
ways
to
grow
his
online
following
and
commercialize
the
business.
he
started
selling
tiger
king–branded
candy,
apparel,
and
condoms.
he
also
kept
zoo
costs
down
by
euthanizing
sterile

defective
tigers
and
turned

of
joe’s
zoo,
the

of

conducted
four
investigations,
including
one
that
looked
into
the
deaths
of
23
tiger
cubs
from
2009
to
2010.
(as
an
endangered
species,
tigers
cannot
be

there
is
a
legitimate
reason,
such
as
ending

animal

what

extremely
crowded

lacking
basic

as

and

who
routinely
abused

in

like
harrison,
baskin
used
to
be
part
of
the
problem.
a
pivot
from
big
cat
owner
to
big
cat
conservationist
is
a
common
story
among
advocates
in
the
field.
baskin
stumbled
into
owning
an
exotic
cat
in
the
early
1990s
at
the
age
of
31.
she
and
her
ex-husband,
don,
worked
together
in
the
real
estate
business.
they
used
llamas
to
mitigate
the
brush
on
the
florida
properties
they
sold,
and
the
easiest
place
to
get
a
llama
was
at
an
exotic
animal
auction.
at
one
memorable
event,
a
man
seated
next
to
baskin
bid
on
a
baby
bobcat.
baskin
couldn’t
help
but
lean
over
and
whisper:
“when
that
cat
grows
up,
she
is
going
to
tear
your
face
off.”
“i’m
a
taxidermist,”
the
man
replied.
“i’m
just
gonna
club
her
in
the
head
in
the
parking
lot
and
make
her
into
a
den
ornament.”
baskin
was
horrified.
don
outbid
the
man
and
they
brought
home
the
6-month-old
kitten,
which
baskin
named
windsong.
as
windsong
grew,
the
bobcat
terrorized
baskin’s
daughter
and
the
family’s
german
shepherd.
the
solution,
baskin
decided,
was
to
get
windsong
a
playmate.
don
found
a
guy
in
minnesota
who
agreed
to
sell
them
a
bobcat
kitten.
turned
out,
the
man
was
a
fur
farmer;
baskin
and
don
came
back
from
that
trip
with
56
bobcat
and
lynx
kittens
—
everything
the
farmer
had
for
sale.
the
following
year,
they
returned
to
rescue
the
28
adult
cats,
too.
with
their
home
overrun
by
exotic
cats,
baskin
and
don
transformed
a
nearby
40-acre
property
they
owned
into
a
sanctuary,
albeit
with
misguided
tourism
and
breeding
components.
they
called
it
wildlife
on
easy
street.
they
amassed
a
collection
of
at
least
150
exotic
cats
of
17
species.
for
$75
a
night,
visitors
could
share
a
small
cabin
with
a
bobcat,
cougar,
or
serval.
baskin
started
breeding
half
a
dozen
big
cat
species,
including
ocelots
and
leopards.
pre-internet,
all
baskin’s
information
came
from
breeders
and
dealers,
who
had
their
own
motivations.
“they
were
saying,
‘oh,
you
should
breed
these
animals
because
they’re
endangered
and
the
zoos
don’t
know
what
they’re
doing
and
they’re
going
to
disappear
from
the
wild,’”
baskin
said.
“so,
we
thought,
well,
that’s
something
we
could
definitely
do
to
help
save
the
cats.”
but
people
who
bought
kittens
from
baskin
often
returned
the
cats
after
they
grew
up.
once,
a
siberian
lynx
—
an
animal
baskin
swore
she
recognized
from
when
it
was
young
—
showed
up
at
auction.
people
started
donating
cats
to
baskin’s
sanctuary
by
the
dozens.
some
years,
she
turned
away
hundreds
of
animals
due
to
a
lack
of
space.
around
the
same
time,
baskin
started
attending
conferences
held
by
the
association
of
zoos
and
aquariums,
where
she
learned
a
few
hard
truths.
none
of
these
cats
had
any
conservation
value
for
their
species.
in
fact,
baskin
realized
big
cats
had
no
business
being
bred
and
kept
as
pets
at
all.
in
1997,
baskin
pulled
a
180.
she
stopped
breeding
and
began
spaying
and
neutering
all
of
her
animals.
she
started
enforcing
a
new
rule
in
2003:
big
cat
rescue,
her
rebranded
sanctuary,
would
take
any
unwanted
tiger,
lion,
savannah,
or
whatever
else,
but
in
return
the
owner
had
to
sign
a
contract
forfeiting
their
right
to
own
a
big
cat.
“we’re
the
only
place
that
absolutely
insists
that
if
you’re
going
to
dump
an
animal
here,
you
are
never
going
to
own
another
exotic
cat,”
baskin
said.
the
contracts
were
a
good
start,
but
carole
had
an
even
bigger
goal
in
mind:
ending
all
big
cat
ownership.
critical
to
realizing
that
vision
is
howard
baskin,
a
businessman
from
poughkeepsie,
new
york,
who
carole
met
at
an
event
at
the
florida
aquarium
in
2002.
(baskin’s
previous
husband
walked
out
the
door
one
day
and
was
never
seen
or
heard
from
again
—
though
she
was
questioned,
no
evidence
was
ever
found
linking
baskin
to
his
disappearance.)
a
lifelong
bachelor
with
a
harvard
mba
and
a
law
degree
from
the
university
of
miami,
howard
appears
in
many
ways
carole’s
opposite.
carole
dresses
like
a
woodstock
attendee
and
carries
herself
with
the
breezy
grace
of
a
dancer.
howard
trundles
along,
turtle-like,
in
dad-style
khakis
with
a
cell
phone
holster.
but
they
make
a
good
team.
howard
handles
the
administrative
and
legal
duties
and
carole
focuses
on
advocacy.
“on
our
honeymoon,
we
wrote
a
25-year
plan
to
stop
the
big
cat
abuses
that
bad
guys
hold
dear,”
carole
said.
carole
and
howard
started
by
setting
up
a
google
alert
for
cub-petting
events
around
the
country.
baskin
would
email
the
venues
explaining
the
downsides
of
cub
petting
and
asking
them
to
cancel
the
event,
and
if
they
did
not
respond,
she
would
then
direct
her
hundreds
of
thousands
of
social
media
followers
to
flood
the
venues
with
emails
explaining
the
downsides
of
cub
petting.

baskin
has
been
pushing
for
this
type
of
reform
since
1998,
when
she
began
working
on
what’s
called
the
captive
wildlife
safety
act,
a
federal
bill
unanimously
voted
into
law
in
2003
that
barred
the
sale
of
big
cats
as
pets
across
state

and

—
along
with
major
nonprofit
groups
such
as
the
humane
society
and
the
international
fund
for
animal
welfare
(ifaw)
—
have
been
pushing
a
new
bill,
the
big
cat
public
safety
act.
first
introduced
in
2012,
the
legislation
would
ban
all
public
contact
with
big
cats,
including
cub
petting,
and
would
require
all
big
cat
owners
to
register
their
animals.
howard
hired
a
top
republican
lobbying
firm
in
2014
to
work
with
harrison
to
champion
the
bill
—
not
for
its
conservation
clout,
but
on
its
pubic
safety
merits.
senator
susan
collins
signed
on
to
the
bill
last
november,
the
first
republican
cosponsor.
three
other
republican
senators,
including
richard
burr
of
north
carolina,
have
since
joined
collins.
the
registrations
would
provide
officials
with
valuable
insight
into
who
owns
what
and
where
—
potentially
life-saving
information
in
the
event
of,
say,
a
tornado
blowing
through
a
tiger
park.
the
ban
on
cub
petting,
though,
is
the
most
important
part
of
the
bill,
as
proponents
believe
it
would
disincentivize
the
breeding
of
big
cats.
last
year,
the
bill
made
it
out
of
the
committee
on
natural
resources
in
a
bipartisan
vote
and
could
soon
head
to
the
house
floor,
where
it
has
broad
support.
“law
enforcement
has
enough
problems
trying
to
protect
the
public
without
having
to
run
into
a
house
where
there
might
be
a
tiger,”
said
harrison.
dozens
of
republican
lawmakers
support
it
—
a
party
full
of
politicians,
who,
harrison
said,
for
the
most
part
“don’t
give
a
crap
about
cats.”
for
now,
though,
cub
petting
remains
a
lucrative
industry.
according
to
data
compiled
by
a
team
of
new
york
university
researchers
in
2016,
at
least
77
facilities
across
the
country
allowed
interactions
with
exotic
animals
(about
a
quarter
of
those
were
with
big
cats).
in
a
follow-up
study
in
2019,
which
focused
specifically
on
tiger
petting,
those
same
zoos
were
still

supporters
of
the
big
cat
public
safety
act
believe
that
ending
cub
petting
would
go
a
long
way
toward
stopping
the
trade
of
big
cats
altogether.
“without
ending
public
contact,
you’re
not
going
to
have
sufficient
incentive
for
all
the
fly-by-night
exhibitors
to
stop
breeding,”
said
nasser.
the
new
protections
would
extend
to
smaller
species
such
as
jaguars
and
even
unnatural
hybrids
like

first.

never
admitted

came

he
was
eager
to
defend
his
innocence.
multiple
times
he
told
me,
“that
whole
mess
was
nothing

a
setup.”
joe
did
cop
to
something
else,
though.
he
said
being
locked
up
in
jail
had
made
him
realize
he’d
mistreated
the
animals
all
those
years,
depriving
them
of
their
freedom
and
robbing
them
of
their
dignity
by
keeping
them
behind
bars.
joe
told
me
he
regretted
having
done
that.
“now
that
i
have
nothing
to
do
besides
sit
in
a
cell
with
no
tv,
no

no
nothing,

know
exactly
what
i
did
to
those
[animals],”
he
said.
“we
can
all
be
drove
crazy
by
doing
nothing.”
to
make
amends,
joe
told
me
he
plans
to
create
a
new
zoo
when
he
gets
out.
